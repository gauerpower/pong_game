# pong_game
Pong game made in Python using Turtle Graphics. Player 1's controls are W/S, player 2's controls are up/down.

Needs some play testing for UI tweaks, but it's pretty much playable.

Ideas for further features:
• Controlling the game speed
• Setting how many points to play to (currently 7)
• Creating a single-player mode with one side controlled by the computer
