# pong_game
Pong game made in Python using Turtle Graphics. Player 1's controls are W/S, player 2's controls are up/down.

Needs some play testing for UI tweaks, but it's pretty much playable. In particular, paddle movement is a little laggy and occasionally the ball gets "stuck" on a paddle and bounces back and forth for a moment.

Ideas for further features:

• Controlling the game speed

• Setting how many points to play to (currently 7)

• Creating a single-player mode with one side controlled by the computer
